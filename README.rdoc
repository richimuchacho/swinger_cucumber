= Swinger
 
This is a little project to facilitate writing acceptance tests for Java/Swing applications using Cucumber and JRuby.

I am using the Jemmy Netbeans library for driving the application.

As a target application I am using the SwingSet2 demo.

Take a look at lib/swinger/step_definitions for the steps available so far.

Here is an acceptance test example using these steps:

  Scenario: Dialog manipulation
    Given the frame "SwingSet" is visible
    When I click the menu "File/About"
    Then I should see the dialog "About Swing!"
    Given the dialog "About Swing!" is visible 
    When I click the button "OK"
    Then I should not see the dialog "About Swing!"

== Running the tests

To run all features on the test app, just type:

 jruby -S cucumber test/features

Or, if you have Rake (which you should!), just go with:

 jruby -S rake

For only a specific feature:

 jruby -S rake ONLY=combobox

For running the test application:

 jruby -S rake test_app

== Using Swinger in your project

Since Swinger is in active development at this points, there is no stable gem
available, so you will have to use Swinger from the source.

To do so, just clone the project with:

 git://github.com/demetriusnunes/swinger.git

Or better yet, fork it and clone it from your own repo, so you can contribute!
 
And within your project, require it in your features/support/env.rb

 require '/path/to/swinger/lib/swinger'
